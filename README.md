# Herbarium specimen image management utilities

- extract files spread across multiple folders
- filter on folder names, file names, or file types

- uniquify a list of values in a column in a CSV file, e.g. barcode numbers
- uniquify file names before moving to another folder (to avoid name clashes on move)
